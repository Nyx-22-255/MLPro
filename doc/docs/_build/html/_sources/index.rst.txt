`MLPro <https://github.com/fhswf/MLPro.git>`_ is a synoptic framework for standardized machine learning tasks in Python!

MLPro was developed in 2021 by `Automation Technology team at Fachhochschule SÃ¼dwestfalen <https://www.fh-swf.de/de/forschung___transfer_4/labore_3/labs/labor_fuer_automatisierungstechnik__soest_1/standardseite_57.php>`_ .
MLPro provides complete, standardized, and reusable functionalities to support your scientific research or industrial project in machine learning.

In MLPro v0.0.0, we provide a standarized Python package for conducting research in reinforcement learning (RL) and game
theoretical (GT) approaches, including environments, algorithms, multi-agent RL (MARL), and many more. Additionally, we
enable our users to reuse the available packages by developing wrapper classes.
