Basic Functions
================

`MLPro <https://github.com/fhswf/MLPro.git>`_ provides a module that consists of common
machine learning functionalities and properties. Additionally, you can also find modules
for basic mathematical classes and various classes with elementry functionalties to be
reused in higher level classes, for example: logging, load/save, timer, data storing, etc.

We provide :ref:`how to files<target-howto-bf>` related to this subject.

Basic Mathematical Functions
-----------------------------------
This module includes Dimension, Set, Element, ElementList, MSpace, and Espace classes.

.. code-block:: bash

    from mlpro.bf.math import * 

Basic Various Classes
-----------------------------------
This module includes load/save, logging, set timer, data storing, data loading, and
data plotting functionalities.


.. code-block:: bash

    from mlpro.bf.various import * 


Basic Machine Learning Functions
-----------------------------------
This module includes hyperparameter setting, hyperparameter tuning, adaptive, and buffer
classes.
