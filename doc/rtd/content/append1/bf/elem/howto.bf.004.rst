================
Ver. 1.2.3 (2021-10-26)

This module demonstrates how to store, plot, save and load variables. In the result section below, an example output shows the plots generated with the help of DataPlotting functionality of MLPro. With the help of Data module in MLPro, data can be stored as python dictionary objects, local binary files and csv files. The plots can also be saved as pdf files. The files can be saved and loaded from the path set.

For this example implementation, following files will be saved in the path provided:
    - model_loss.pdf
    - reward.pdf
    - states_1.pdf
    - states_2.pdf
    - data_storage.csv
    - data_memory.pkl
    - plot_memory.pkl

The results also show a comparison between the data loaded from the csv and binary format.

The following figures show the plots generated by implementing the Data module in MLPro:

.. image:: images/model_loss.png
	:width: 49%
.. image:: images/reward.png
	:width: 49%
.. image:: images/states_1.png
	:width: 49%
.. image:: images/states_2.png
	:width: 49%

This is the comparison between the data loaded from the binary and csv files using the load methods:

::

	Comparison :
	Original data                : 2.73498
	Loaded data from binary file : 2.73498
	Comparison :
	Original data             : 2.73498
	Loaded data from csv file : 2.73498


The above results can be generated by executing the script given in the example code section of this document.

Prerequisites
