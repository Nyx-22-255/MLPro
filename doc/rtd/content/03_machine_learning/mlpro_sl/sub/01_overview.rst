Overview
--------

MLPro provides a subtopic package for supervised learning, namely MLPro-SL.
At the moment, the implementation is still limited but we are working on it and improving to bring you the full supervised learning functionalities in the near future.
The current implementation covers:

 - A base class of an adaptive function for supervised learning
 - A base class of an adaptive function for feedforward neural networks, including MLP
 - Ready-to-use PyTorch-based MLP networks in the pool of objects
