Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
----------------------------------------------

Model-based RL contains two learning paradigms, such as learning the environment (model-based learning )and utilizing the model (e.g. as action planner).
To practice model-based RL in MLPro-RL package, here are a howto file that can be followed:

(1) :ref:`Howto RL-MB-001: MBRL on RobotHTM Environment <Howto MB RL 001>`, and 

(2) :ref:`Howto RL-MB-002: MBRL with MPC on Grid World Environment <Howto MB RL 002>`.
