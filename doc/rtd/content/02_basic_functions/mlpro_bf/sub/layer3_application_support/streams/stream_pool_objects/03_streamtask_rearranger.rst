Rearranger
==========
A stream object consists of a Feature Space with a number of features defining each instance at a given timestep. A
Rearranger task in MLPro maps the features of an input stream instances to a user defined feature space as an output.
In other words, a rearranger task can be used to filter out un-interested features of a stream object for a
particular task.
