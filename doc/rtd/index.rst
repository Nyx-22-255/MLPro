MLPro - Machine Learning Professional
=====================================

Welcome to MLPro - the integrative middleware-framework for standardized machine learning in Python!

MLPro provides advanced, scientific-level models and templates for a continuously growing number of sub-areas of ML.
These are embedded in standard processes for training and real operations. Furthermore, numerous popular 3rd party 
packages can easily be integrated.

MLPro is made for scientists, engineers, developers, and students who value
   - powerful and flexible templates for their next ML project
   - standard proceedings for training, hyperparameter tuning, and real operations
   - numerous ready-to-run example codes and benchmark objects for self-study


MLPro is made by scientists to
   - speed up your next ML project
   - achieve comparable results for your next publication
