# MLPro - Machine Learning Professional
Machine Learning Professional - A Synoptic Framework for Standardized Machine Learning Tasks in Python

MLPro was developed in 2021 by [Automation Technology and Learning Systems team at Fachhochschule SÃ¼dwestfalen](https://www.fh-swf.de/de/forschung___transfer_4/labore_3/labs/labor_fuer_automatisierungstechnik__soest_1/standardseite_57.php)

MLPro provides complete, standardized, and reusable functionalities to support your scientific research, educational task, or industrial project in machine learning.

In the first version of MLPro, we provide a standardized Python package for reinforcement learning (RL) and game theoretical (GT) approaches, including environments, algorithms, multi-agent RL (MARL), model-based RL (MBRL) and many more. Additionally, we incorporate the available third party packages by developing wrapper classes to enable our users to reuse the third party packages in MLPro.
